# CA2

I am using the same project as CA1 (this is way it is the same djangoproject name), I just added the accounts sytsmen. This is a simple web application built with Django that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database of drivers and cars with an account system.

# Developing process 

Create login, sign-in, logout, and change password views: Create views for login, sign-in, logout, and change password operations in the app's views.py file.

Define URL patterns for authentication views: Define URL patterns for the authentication views in the app's urls.py file.

Create templates for authentication views: Create HTML templates for the authentication views.

Add authentication middleware: Add authentication middleware to the project's settings.py file.

Add login and logout URLs to your navigation menu: Add links to the login and logout views in your app's navigation menu.

I didn't use the email sent system because it didn't work for me. If you want to change your password you have to go to your profile and click on "Change password".

# Purpose 

The purpose of the application would be to help manage and organize data related to F1 cars and drivers, making it easier for users to access and manipulate this information as needed. Allowing users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and create accounts, change password, signin, login, logout.
